## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** with **MVVM** pattern:

```
Presentation Layer (UI + Cubit)
        ↓
Domain Layer (Repository Interfaces)
        ↓
Data Layer (Repository Implementations + Services)
        ↓
Appwrite Backend
```

### Key Principles:

- **Separation of Concerns** - Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion** - High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Testability** - Easy to unit test each layer independently
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new features without affecting existing code

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Flutter** 3.0+ - Cross-platform UI framework
- **flutter_bloc** (Cubit) - State management
- **go_router** - Navigation
- **get_it** - Dependency injection
- **google_fonts** - Typography
- **fl_chart** - Analytics charts
- **table_calendar** - Schedule calendar

### Backend
- **Appwrite** - Backend as a Service
  - Authentication
  - Database (NoSQL)
  - Storage
  - Realtime subscriptions

### Development Tools
- **Node.js** - Appwrite setup script
- **Dart** - Programming language

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (3.0 or higher) - [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK** (3.0 or higher) - Comes with Flutter
- **Node.js** (14 or higher) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Appwrite** - Either:
  - [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) (Recommended for quick start)
  - [Self-hosted Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) (For production)
- **Git** - Version control
- **Code Editor** - VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check Flutter
flutter --version

# Check Dart
dart --version

# Check Node.js
node --version

# Check npm
npm --version
```

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quran-gate-academy.git
cd quran-gate-academy
```

### 2. Set Up Appwrite Backend

#### Create Appwrite Project

1. Go to [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) or your self-hosted instance
2. Create a new project
3. Note down your:
   - **Project ID**
   - **API Endpoint** (e.g., `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`)
   - **API Key** (Create one with full permissions)

#### Run Automated Setup Script

```bash
cd appwrite-setup
npm install
```

Create `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Appwrite credentials:

```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Run the setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will automatically create:
- Database
- All collections (9 collections)
- Attributes for each collection
- Indexes for optimized queries
- Permissions

### 3. Configure Flutter App

Navigate to Flutter app directory:

```bash
cd ../flutter_app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Update Appwrite configuration in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`:

```dart
class AppConfig {
  static const String appwriteEndpoint = 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1';
  static const String appwriteProjectId = 'your-project-id';
  static const String appwriteDatabaseId = 'quran_gate_db';
  // ...
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### 1. Dashboard

Teachers see:
- Total teaching hours (weekly/monthly)
- Hours taken vs. remaining
- Attendance percentage
- Salary till today
- Today's classes list

Calculation formulas:
```dart
// Total Hours
totalHours = sum(completedSessions.duration) / 60

// Salary Till Today
salary = sum(completedSessions.salaryAmount)

// Attendance Percentage
attendance = (completedSessions / totalScheduledSessions) * 100
```

### 2. Schedule & Availability

**Teacher Availability:**
- Teachers define weekly availability (day, start time, end time)
- Multiple time slots per day
- Can mark specific times as unavailable

**Calendar View:**
- Weekly/Monthly view
- Shows availability and assigned sessions
- Color-coded status indicators

**Admin Session Assignment:**
1. Admin receives student request (via WhatsApp)
2. Admin checks teacher availability
3. Admin assigns teacher and creates sessions
4. Sessions appear in teacher's schedule

### 3. Class Session Workflow

**Session Statuses:**
- `scheduled` - Initial status when created
- `completed` - Marked by teacher after session
- `absent` - Student didn't attend
- `student_cancel` - Student cancelled
- `teacher_cancel` - Teacher cancelled

**Status Change Rules:**
- Teachers can only update status after scheduled end time
- Completed sessions contribute to salary
- Status changes trigger salary recalculation

### 4. Reschedule Flow

1. **Teacher Request:**
   - Teacher selects session
   - Proposes new date/time
   - Provides reason
   - Creates RescheduleRequest

2. **Admin Review:**
   - Admin sees pending requests
   - Reviews reason and new proposed time
   - Checks availability conflicts
   - Approves or rejects with notes

3. **Update Session:**
   - If approved: ClassSession updated with new date/time
   - Teacher notified
   - Calendar updated

### 5. Salary Calculation

**Automatic Calculation:**
```dart
// Per Session
sessionSalary = (teacherHourlyRate) * (sessionDuration / 60)

// Monthly Total
monthlySalary = sum(completedSessionsInMonth.salaryAmount)
                - fines
                + bonuses
```

**Salary Record:**
- Generated monthly for each teacher
- Includes: totalHours, totalAmount, fines, bonuses, netAmount
- Status: pending → paid

## 💻 Development Guide

### Adding a New Feature

Follow the feature template in [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md):

1. Create service layer (data/services/)
2. Create repository interface (domain/repositories/)
3. Create repository implementation (data/repositories/)
4. Create state classes (presentation/cubit/)
5. Create cubit (presentation/cubit/)
6. Create UI pages (presentation/pages/)
7. Register in dependency injection

### Code Style

- Follow [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use const constructors where possible

### State Management

This project uses **Cubit** (simplified Bloc):

```dart
// Emit states
emit(LoadingState());
emit(LoadedState(data));
emit(ErrorState(message));

// Listen to states
BlocBuilder<MyCubit, MyState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is LoadingState) return LoadingWidget();
    if (state is LoadedState) return DataWidget(state.data);
    return ErrorWidget();
  },
)
```

### Navigation

Using **go_router**:

```dart
// Navigate
context.go('/dashboard');
context.push('/students/123');

// Go back
context.pop();
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/features/auth/auth_cubit_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

```dart
// Unit test example
test('login with valid credentials should emit AuthAuthenticated', () async {
  // Arrange
  when(mockRepository.login(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password'))
      .thenAnswer((_) async => mockUser);

  // Act
  await cubit.login(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password');

  // Assert
  expect(cubit.state, isA<AuthAuthenticated>());
});
```
